## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Built with focus on modularity using SASS and SASS partials

## Notes

For a single web page like this, using SASS in the way I used it is not the fastest way of doing things, but I just wanted to practice working with SASS partials for larger projects.

Also I'm using bem naming convention but probably not in the most efficient way which may have led to a crowded markup.
